# Text-to-Speech (TTS) System

## Introduction

Text-to-Speech (TTS) is a technology that converts text into speech. This project aims to create a TTS system that produces natural-sounding speech from given text inputs. The system leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to enhance user interaction across various platforms.

## Features

- **Natural Sounding Speech**: Converts text to speech that closely resembles a native speaker.
- **Multi-Language Support**: The system can be extended to support multiple languages and speakers.
- **Emotion-Based TTS**: Development of an Emotion-Based Text-to-Speech (EBTTS) system using LSTM networks to convey emotions in speech.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for converting typed text to speech.

## Applications

- **Voice Assistants**: Creation of voice assistants on smart devices with natural speech elements such as emphasis.
- **Announcement Systems**: Used in airports and public transportation systems for automated announcements.
- **Assistive Technologies**: Beneficial for storytelling, audiobooks, and assistive technologies for the visually impaired.

## Future Implementations

- **Telephony**: Integration of TTS in telephony systems.
- **ATMs**: Use of TTS in automated teller machines.
- **Video Games**: Enhancing in-game character voices with TTS technology.
